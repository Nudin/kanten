kanten: japanese for word for agar, a gelatinous substance derived from seaweed.

This program was inspired by a similar one called [Tofu][] for OS X, a
column-based reader application, where the columns are arranged horizontally.
Given the aspect ratio of computer monitors, I decided to create kanten to be a
unix pager replacement (more and less) that is not limited to 80 columns.
